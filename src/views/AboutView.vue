    <div class="info">
       <p>My name is Abdullahi Mohamed and I'm a recent graduate. I have some experience with programming language such as PHP, C#, Java, Python, JavaScript as well as VueJs. 
      This website is created with VueJs, so that's that.
      I'm trying to be a web developer, even though clearly I need more practice in that department.
